The ImageDataGenerator function in the above code is a utility function from the tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image module. It's used to generate batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation. The data will be looped over (in batches) indefinitely.

In the above code, two instances of the ImageDataGenerator class were created, one for the training data and one for the validation data. The rescale argument is set to 1./255, which normalizes the pixel values in the image data between 0 and 1.

The shear_range, zoom_range, and horizontal_flip arguments are used for data augmentation. The shear_range argument randomly applies shearing transformations to the images, the zoom_range argument randomly zooms in and out of the images and the horizontal_flip argument randomly flips the images horizontally.

Data augmentation is a technique that is used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by creating modified versions of the images. This can help prevent overfitting by making the model more robust to variations in the data.

The flow_from_directory method is used to load the images from the disk and their labels from the directory structure, and it generates batches of augmented data.

The use of the ImageDataGenerator function in combination with the flow_from_directory method is a common practice when working with image datasets, it allows for real-time data augmentation and makes it easy to load data from disk.
